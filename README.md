# ClinicalVolumes-medical-imaging-software

## Abstract
Background: Modern medical imaging relies on the accurate and rapid image analysis due to the large size of datasets collected on a daily basis both in clinical and pre-clinical imaging, for diagnosis, treatment planning, and research purposes. In order to improve the technology behind such requirements, here we introduce a new image analysis software called ClinicalVolumes. ClinicalVolumes is a semi-automatic image volume analysis tool based on a clustering signal intensity threshold-based method. It has been developed in C++ and can run on both Windows and Mac OS X operating systems. The program is currently available for research use only at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prot78/clinicalvolumes. 

Results: ClinicalVolumes has been validated with several MRI applications but it also can process Echocardiography and CT images. MRI datasets of clinical cardiac cases, and pre-clinical mouse models of heart, brain and adipose tissues have been analyzed by the ClinicalVolumes software and results were compared to a full manual segmentation. Bland-Altman analysis, intra- and inter-observer variability are reported for all investigated MRI applications as a numeric validation. The accuracy error was estimated to be below 10% and the segmentation was from 2 to 4 times faster, depending on the application, when compared to a full manual segmentation.

Conclusions: ClinicalVolumes is a fast, robust, user-friendly and accurate tool for image segmentation aimed to improve volume analysis in numerous medical applications ranging from cardiovascular disease to tumor and brain imaging.

## Background
Image segmentation plays a central rule in the increasing number of multidimensional and multimodality datasets generated by digital imaging techniques [1, 2]. The medical field, in particular, relies on computer programs to study the large amount of data collected by medical equipment, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Echocardiography or Computer Tomography (CT), in order to improve diagnosis or determine appropriate treatment [3]. The progression towards automated or semi-automated segmentation software, which can provide accurate results in a shortened analysis time, is therefore of critical interest [4].

Tissue volume analysis such as that of heart [5], brain [6], cancer [7], vascular tissues, bones, or adipose tissues [8], provides a powerful tool to investigate functional and volumetric parameters. In cardiac studies, for instance, ejection fraction (EF), left ventricle end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) and left ventricle end-systolic volume (LVESV), are essential parameters to determine the conditions of the organ and the health status of the patient. An accurate and reliable segmentation of the left ventricle (LV) is therefore of great clinical and pre-clinical interest. The same applies to all medical imaging fields where accurate and reliable segmentations can result in useful diagnostic information so as to help target treatments. 

Recent years have seen a rapid evolution of medical image analysis software [4, 9-11]. However a large number of those are specifically designed to investigate single organs rather than providing a means for broader applications. The software here introduced, named ClinicalVolumes, was validated on MR volumes but has the potential to also analyze images from other medical imaging modalities including echocardiography, computed tomography (CT) or positron emission tomography (PET) in addition to be a specific application software. ClinicalVolumes is able to reduce analysis time with respect to a full manual segmentation by using an efficient clustering threshold-based technique to limit areas of interest and also by a rich set of user-friendly graphical-editing capabilities. The software exploits an automatic segmentation together with a user-friendly manual image optimization approach thus making ClinicalVolumes a valuable semi-automated program. 

The accuracy and efficiency of the new software has been evaluated for several MRI applications and the results are here reported. The tool is routinely used to perform cardiovascular MRI image analysis in our laboratories, thereby providing valuable diagnostic information for pre-clinical studies in murine models of cardiac diseases [12].
